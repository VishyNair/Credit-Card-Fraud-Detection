Understanding and Defining Fraud <br>
Credit card fraud is any dishonest act and behaviour to obtain information without the proper authorization from the account holder for financial gain. Among different ways of frauds, Skimming is the most common one, which is the way of duplicating of information located on the magnetic strip of the card. Apart from this, the other ways are:<br>

Manipulation/alteration of genuine cards <br>
- Creation of counterfeit cards <br>
- Stolen/lost credit cards<br>
- Fraudulent telemarketing<br>

Card Fraud - An Inside Edge <br>
The global general purpose brands-American Express, Diners Club/Discover, JCB, Mastercard, Visa, and UnionPay-combined for $33.731 trillion or 83.12 percentage of total worldwide card volume (purchases and cash) in 2018. Gross fraud for the global brand cards amounted to $24.86 billion in 2018, an increase of 16.9% over $21.27 billion the previous year. The global brand cards combined to account for 89.26 percentage of gross fraud losses worldwide for all cards in 2018, up from 88.75 percentage the prior year. In three years (2023), total payment card volume worldwide is projected to reach $57.080 trillion and gross card fraud is projected to reach $35.67 billion.<br>
Issuer losses occurred when criminals took over valid accounts, cards were lost or stolen or counterfeited, new accounts were opened with the intent to commit fraud, accounts were opened using a mix of valid and bogus information (synthetic fraud), cardholders or their family members made purchases and then disputed the charges (friendly fraud), and a few smaller categories.<br>

Account takeover and synthetic fraud losses grew in 2018, helped by the abundance of personally identifiable information (PII) available for sale on the dark web. Both are madle easier for criminals by new credit account applications that originate from mobile devices. Data breaches can provide 100 percentage of the information needed for an account takeover. The theft of healthcare records, which are rich in PII, are a particular problem. Criminals purchase PII, gain access to a valid account, change key details, and have a new card mailed to a different address. Account takeovers can result in a quick loss to fraud.
